#+TITLE: Node Docker ECS tutorial

I'm learning to deploy to ECS

* Step 1 create a node app
it's just a hello worldy

* Docker tag command

docker tag SOURCE_IMAGE[:TAG] TARGET_IMAGE[:TAG]

image names are optionally prefixed by a hostname

no hostname => docker public registry

* Open repo to learn commands for how to push to that repo

Since these commands are completely opaque in terms of meaning and super long
and not human-friendly, I'm assuming we're supposed to script them away.

* Pattern

It seems like the pattern is going to be

1. Figure out what resources to add
2. add those to the terraform file
3. apply those with `terraform apply`
